There was a fat glass ashtray at Miss Izi's elbow. She grabbed it and
tossed it at her ex-husband. It was a mild, casual toss, flung like a
Frisbee. She didn't even mean to strike him, and she didn't. Instead,
the ashtray struck a pregnant woman in the shoulder. She was dancing
near the front of the crowd with her boyfriend, and she quickly spun
around and slapped Dominic, who was standing behind her, holding the
doll. Being a gentleman, Dominic raised his hand to stop her from
striking him a second time and inadvertently clunked the
young mother's boyfriend on the head with the doll's hard battery
head. In turn, the boyfriend reached his fist to whack Dominic, but
instead his elbow struck Bum-Bum in the jaw, who had stepped over to
help the Bum-Bum, furious at being hit, flung a punch at her assailant
and struck Sister Gee, who fell into Eleanora Soto, treasurer of the
Cause Houses Puerto Rican Statehood Society, who was sipping a cup of
whiskey, which she spilled down the shirt of Calvin, the Transit
Authority worker who had just given Sportcoat his five-dollar lunch
money.
