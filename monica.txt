Hi Monica,

I not only often don't remember if I've loaned a book, or whom I've
loaned it to, or if it was a loan or a gift, or for that matter, what
book it was. But then I am lucky to have friends who follow up and
remind me what is what. Emoji

Anyway, great. Yeah, I think I was wondering what Burn Out's history
was. I do remember liking it a lot. Those are the ones I put sticky notes
in saying I'd like them back. Thanks so much.

I am deeply immersed in my 2nd reading of Louise Penny's The Brutal
Telling. Linda really likes this author. It's taken me this reread to
realize how good this author and this particular book is.

So, no, no new Kinsellas in the queue. It's going to be very difficult
(I think) to be better than the two we've both read (Wedding Night and
My Not So Perfect Life). But, as the Barnes and Noble paper bag says ...
So Many Books ...

I've put a note in my calendar to show up @ the library to see you at 10
on Tuesday..

Lee
