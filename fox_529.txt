So furious, Zwender could hardly speak. Still the younger man
insolently held his ground instead of backing off. Might've apologized
or at least shrugged to signal he knew he'd overstepped with the
questioning, he was (maybe) sorry but stung by redneck cousins con-
tinued to smirk at Zwender setting Zwender into a rage as if the
zipper-stitches in his skull were pulsing electricity, with the flat of his
hand Zwender struck Odom's right shoulder sending Odom stagger-
ing against a table, instinctively Odom shoved back with both hands
forcing Zwender off-balance, reached out then to steady Zwender
gripping his arm at the elbow which threw Zwender into a greater
rage striking Odom above the right eye with his fist, hard enough to
break the skin.
