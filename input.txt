To her I flee; fine position. Trap all up, 
I won hat, last ewe, kilt, rat sets, a tooth, 
Self, no wars. I, lion, a leg? Nay. 
Men impugn in rub mill: animal spirit, 
Safe buoy, no main. I won't. In if fits? No. 
Is sap a spill? Later. I fall asleep 
Till H's a help mission. On back! 
Curtsey fixes her, eh? Sex if yes; 
Truck cab, no. No is simple. Ha! Still, it peels, 
All afire, tall lips, a passion stiff in it. 
Now! In! I am on you! Be fast! I rip! 
Slam In all! I'm burning up! Mine! My angel! 
An oil is raw on flesh, too; tastes tart, 
Like wet salt. Ah, now I pull apart! 
No, it is open. I feel fire: hot.
