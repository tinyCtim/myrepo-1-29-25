I learned about all this from my friend Howard Goldstein.

<p>

The way I programmed this hinges on the fact that you can put error
handlers on servers to trap specific errors. A file named .htaccess is
used to define the page to run for a specific error. In this case, the
file not found (code 404) error is handled by the page 2461.html which
simply tells the user his entry did not qualify and provides a link back
to the original form.

<p>

Here's what's in the .htaccess file:

<p>

ErrorDocument 404 http://www.primepuzzle.com/246/2461.html

<p>

The main program, 246.html, has a form on it which has an input text box
named "foobar." When the user presses the Enter key the value entered in
this box is passed as a parameter back to 246.html which has parameter
detecting JavaScript code which issues the command

<p>

location='246'+foobar+'.html';

<p>

where foobar is the value of the number entered by the user.

<p>

This means, for example, that the page 2462030.html gets launched if the
user put 2030 in the form.

<p>

There are 31 pages on the server in the 246 directory. All but 4 of them
are .html files. The 4 odd balls are a .js file which is part of the
command tail parameter logic, the .htaccess error handler file, a .wav
file that's played when the user gets the answer and a .jpg that appears
on the same answer page, 2462006.html. That leaves 27 .html files. This
is one of them. 26 = 23 correct answers + 1 to handle the "answer" 2030
+ 1 to handle the main program that asks for a guess (246.html) + the
file 2461.html discussed above.
