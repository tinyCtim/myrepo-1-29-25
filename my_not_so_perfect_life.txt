My review of My Not So Perfect Life by Sophie Kinsella

I absolutely loved this book.

I am trying to remember how I first learned about Sophie Kinsella. I
think it was in the English Lab at the community college where I work (I
tutor math, the English Lab is next door). My friend Alanna had a copy
of The Burnout and said it was funny.

Fast forward, my book club friend Monica recommended this book (I had
given her Surprise Me). (I am now reading Wedding Night, which she also
recommended.) As I was reading the last 100 pages of My Not So Perfect
Life I made a note to myself to email her to thank her for telling me
about it. It was so good I have ordered a copy and will put it in my
lending/giving library I have at work.

So ... why do I love this book so much?

Let's summarize the basic plot.

Katie (who wants to go by Cat, until she doesn't) is working in London.
The company is a "branding' company. Demeter is her boss. Very talented.
But a bit ditzy. She (Demeter) is forgetful. Katie is fired for reasons
unclear. Alex Astalis is Demeter's lover. Maybe. Katie can't keep her
eyes off of him.

Now jobless, Katie goes "on sabbatical" to the family farm. Her talents
as a brander bloom; the farm becomes a destination glamper's paradise.
Demeter, then Alex, show up, and just about everything that is assumed
about who loves whom, who is a terrible person etc. etc., go south.

You have to try this one. Sophie Kinsella is funny, for sure. But My Not So
Perfect Life is good for many other reasons.
