On page 133 we read 

“Hmmph. Young man, let me just say this, I’m one-sixteenth black, an
eighth Irish, two-fifths Choctaw, one-thirty-second Dutch, a quarter
English, and a ninth German.” I didn’t, nor did I want to, do the math,
but it was clear that he was ten-tenths crazy.

For the math inclined, how far from 1 is the sum of these fractions?

To at least 5 decimal places.  ??
