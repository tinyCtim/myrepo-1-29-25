this program reads a file (supplied by the user) and reports the number
of times each of the 26 lowercase letters occur.

int and char variables are declared.

the readfile function takes 3 arguments, the name of the file to be
read, a character buffer to hold what's read, and the maximum number of
bytes to read.

the countch function take 3 arguments, the address of character buffer to be
searched, the address of the last character in the character buffer, and
the character to be searched for.

an integer array is declared and used to hold the counts. notice the use
of parentheses (C uses brackets). there really isn't a need to use an
array but it was thought future enhancements might be made that would
use it (for example, it could be sorted in ascending order).
