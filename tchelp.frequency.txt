currently, this program reads its own source file and reports the number
of times each of the 26 lowercase letters occur.

the readfile function takes 3 arguments, the name of the file to be
read, a character buffer to hold what's read, and the maximum number of
bytes to read.

the countch function take 3 arguments, the address of character buffer to be
searched, the address of the last character in the character buffer, and
the character to be searched for.

an integer array is declared and used to hold the counts. there really
isn't a need to use an array but it was thought future enhancements
might be made that would use it (for example, it could be sorted in
ascending order).
