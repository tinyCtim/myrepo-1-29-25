Mouse Interpreter, Peter Grogono

Ref: "Mouse:, a language for microcomputers", Petrocelli Books Inc., 1983
Language: Turbo Pascal, CP/M 80, Implemented: 3/21/86 by Lee Bradley

2/13/88  & command added. Now other .MSE files are invokable.

2/17/88  Removed inline and bdos usage.

7/06/90  Three bugs involving the apostrophe fixed (bracketed sequences, 
         macros and end of program.) Calculation stack size put at 250. 
         Recompiled with end address of 7d00, without error messages, under
         CP/M 2.2. Now runs correctly under Z-System on a Royal.

10/03/90 Added ParamStr function, allowing program to recognize command
         tail. Z-System dependent now. Broke source up into several
         include files. Compiled under Z-System with end address of 8800
         without error messages. Must use alias that pokes Z3ENV address into
         compiler as per NZ-TOOL.BOX comment.

10/13/90 Added Z3 existence check. Works under CP/M 2.2 again. Disregards
         any command tail.


3/15/07  Increased both envstacksize and maxaddr. Compile w/ end address
         of a000. Changed date announced by main program to 2007.

3/25/25  Removed Z-System stuff. Compiled w/ Free Pascal.
