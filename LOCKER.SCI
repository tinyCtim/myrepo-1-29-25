# A high school has a new principal. On his first day he had his students
# perform an opening day ceremony. There are 1000 lockers and 1000
# students in the school. The principal asks the first student to go to
# every locker and open it. Then he asks the second student to go to every
# second locker (even #) and close it. He has the third student go to
# every third locker and open it if it's closed and close it if it's open.
# He has the fourth student do this to every fourth locker and so on.
# After the process is completed with the 1000th student how many lockers
# are open?
