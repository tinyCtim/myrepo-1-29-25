In baseball, the letter "K" is used to represent a strikeout because
early baseball statistician Henry Chadwick used it to signify "struck"
when scoring games. Since the letter "S" was already used for
"sacrifice," Chadwick chose "K" as it was the last letter of the word
"struck". Later, a backward "K" came to be used to denote a strikeout
where the batter didn't swing at the third strike.
