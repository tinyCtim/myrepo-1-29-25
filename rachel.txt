<pre>It's been a little quiet here so I thought it was a good time
to talk about a couple of races. Today, there was a horse race.

Rachel Alexandra, ridden by Calvin Borel, won the 134th Preakness Stakes.

Tomorrow, there's a 5K in Newington. I doubt I could catch Rachel.
She's got 4 legs and I've only got 2. This means she is twice as fast as me,
right?

The good news is she "runs like a girl." Which means I have the
advantage, right? Woops, sexist remark. My bad.

On a completely unrelated note, I got some Casper seeds from Max
a couple of days ago. I'm back in the pumpkin business. Yipppeeee!
